# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Wheel Of Jeopardy

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game thats a combination of wheel of fortune and jeopardy.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Two player game, first player spins a wheel with different outcomes (points, bankruptcy...) using random function, player then choose a question topic and a random question under that topic is displayed using lists and random function, players then race to answer the question player 1's button is '1' and players '2' button is '2' what button is pressed first decides who answers the question, check if the answer is right using dictionaries and add the amount or subtract the amount of points depending if the question was answered correctly, repeat untill a player gets a score of 1000.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Nope

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

None

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Everything above excpet players don't race to answer the question, so who ever selected the topic that round answers the question.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The better outcome would include the racing aspect.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would include visuals, like a wheel that spins, but I don't have the skill for that and I currently 
don't have the time to learn the skills.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I'm going to get a lot better at the basics, like loops, methods, lists, dictionaries, and if-else statements. I'm going to have to learn how to program so that when a certain button on the computer is pushed something happens, like if a player presses '1' that means the score will be either added or subtracted from player 1's current score and not player 2's.
