## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Write a program thats a mix and similar to the game wheel of fortune and jeopardy. It can have multiple players. User spins a wheel to determine the number of points the question is, spinning and landing on a lower number of points will be more common but there will be variety of things to spin and land on like bankruptcy and so forth, player then chooses a question topic and a question under that topic willl be displayed, which ever player clicks a button first gets to answer the question, game is to a certain number of points, and so forth. There are many more things I can add to the program to increase the fun and difficulty along the way.
