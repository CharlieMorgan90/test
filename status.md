Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created a working game. The game selects a random amount of points for each spin (using a list and random function), lets the current player choose the topic, displays a random question from that topic (using txt files), has the players race (using user input tho) for who gets to answer the question, if they are right they get the points if they are wrong they lose the points, players can skip the question if they want, players take turns choosing the topic and spining the wheel, game stops running after a player reaches a certain number of points. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to figure out how to make it so questions don't repeat. I wanted players to race without using user input and rather by importing the keyboard. I don't have a visual wheel. There are many other little technical errors and I need to format the game better. Add more things to the wheel, like bankruptcy maybe ext... 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I was trying to figure out how to make is so when a certain key is pressed something happens. Lets say I programmed a stop watch when i hit the space bar the watch would instantly stop, and you can't do that with user input. I looked it up online and everything said to download keyboard and import it, but I couldn't figure out how to download keyboard, so I just used user input in my program instead.
